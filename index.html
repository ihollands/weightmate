<p>Gym buddy matching site to connect you with lifting parters near your gym</p>

<p>One of the biggest challenges that I have found with coding has been foreseeing and proactively reconciling my ambitions and aspirations for my projects with my ability.</p>

<p>On the one hand, I learned an enormous amount about user authorization in the MEAN stack (not to mention, quite a bit about the MEAN stack itself and how its elements interact). On the other hand, I focused so heavily on getting user authorization to work, and function, that I failed to enact any of the business logic which would have made my site more worthwhile.</p>

<p>I lament that, in its present state, my site does not function nor look as I had wished. However, I am very happy to say that I understand (at least on a fundamental level) how user auth works via a JS framework, and I hope to work the business logic into the site in short order.</p>

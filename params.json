On the other hand, I focused so heavily on getting user authorization to work, and function, that I failed to enact any of the business logic which would have made my site more worthwhile.\r\n\r\nI lament that, in its present state, my site does not function nor look as I had wished. However, I am very happy to say that I understand (at least on a fundamental level) how user auth works via a JS framework, and I hope to work the business logic into the site in short order.\r\n",
